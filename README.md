# AndroidStudio_JustJava

Make an Android app with buttons and text fields that a user can interact with. Together weâ€™ll make the Just Java app, which allows a user to fill out a form to order coffee.

We picked this project because nearly every popular app involves accepting some type of user input and doing something with that data. For example, in a chat app, you type in a message and it gets sent to a friend. Hence, knowing how to accept user input is a critical milestone on the way to becoming an experienced app developer.
