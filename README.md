# 2018 - Final Project - Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics

Project Overview
The Quiz App project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the course. You will be making your own Android app - taking it from the idea stage to building out the full app. You can share your app with family and friends, as well as with other students in this course.

The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice. We want you to be creative about how you accomplish this. It’s up to you what the quiz questions will be about and how you want to present them to your user. (We recommend about 4 - 10 quiz questions for a reasonable scope of your app).

RUBRIC
Layout

• Overall Layout - App contains 4 - 10 questions, including at least one check box, one radio button, and one text entry.

• Question types - Questions are in a variety of formats such as free text response, checkboxes, and radio buttons. Checkboxes are only used for questions with multiple right answers. Radio buttons are only used for questions with a single right answer.

• Submit button - App includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score.

• Layout best practices - The code adheres to all of the following best practices: Text sizes are defined in sp, Lengths are defined in dp, Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.

• View variety - The app includes at least four of the following Views: TextView, ImageView, Button, Checkbox, EditText, LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, ScrollView, RadioButton, RadioGroup. - If applicable, the app uses nested ViewGroups to reduce the complexity of the layout.

• Rotation - The content should not be cut off if the device is rotated to landscape mode.

Functionality

• Runtime Errors - The code runs without errors.

• Question answers - Each question has a correct answer.

• Radio button implementation - Any question which uses radio buttons allows only one to be checked at once.

• Control statements - The app contains at least one if/else statement.

• Grading button function - The grading button displays a toast which accurately displays the results of the quiz.

• Grading Logic - The grading logic checks each answer correctly. The app accurately calculates the number of correct answers and does not include incorrect answers in the count.

Code Readability

• Naming conventions - All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.

• Format - The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines. There are no unused variables or methods. There is no commented out code. The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.
